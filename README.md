# Bad Buccaneers

A series of fun-filled pirate-themed, multiplayer micro-games. Join a crew, bring your mateys, & see which one of yarr can get the most treasure

Adventures be various, as you sea-faring dogs must compete in a series of small games no longer than 30 seconds, varying from swordplay, launching yourself from cannons, stealing treasure, avoiding sharks, memorizing maps, & peeling oranges. Scurvy be a harsh mistress.

Check out the pitch below!
